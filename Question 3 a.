Inheritance can be used to obain and manipulate student details by allowing the creation hierarchy of classes that models the relationship between different types of courses and their stages. We can create a Course known as class as the parent class and three child classes namely; ICT-Course, Law-Course, and Business-Course. The ICT-Course class can have child classes such as Certification, Diplomae and degree, with each of these having child classes for their respective years.
These classes can also have member variables for capturing student details, such as Name, Reg.No, and course-related details such as Course code, Year of study, and Marks scored.
By using inheritance, reuse the code and avoid duplicating it everytime, as well as providing a clear and structured way of organizing student details according to their course and year reached. This makes it easier to manage and manipulate student data in a structured and efficient way.
